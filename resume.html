     <p> 
       Honestly, I can't even realize what am I doing here. It's just... For some reason I desided to tell someone about myself, but it's hard to make it in the real life.
       So, hello and let me introduce myself. <br>
       First, I am the laziest man ever. In fakt, even this page i was writting for the whole my free day (and I have every my day free). <br>
       Second, you wont ever find the bastard more stupid than me. You can see this by my english language knowledges. <br>
       And third, I really am the best friend you'll ever have, and I can guarantee this. <br><br> So, nice to meet you too. We have a lo-o-ong way forward.

    <h2> Some info about me </h2>
    <p> Well, it's a long way back, so I wont tell you everything you may want to know. Just a bit. How would I know, may be you don't deserve more. It's quite possible.</p>
    <div class="main"> My birth </div>
    <p> Eighteen years ago I was born in place named... It has a stupid russian name, so let's call it simply "Town".
        Now I think that Town is a worst place on the Earth, but I never gave a damn about Town when I lived there 'cause i didn't care about anything.
        For the whole my childhood life wasn't interesting me, I never did any hobbies and I didn't have any friends exept one or two guys as wierd as me. </p>
        <div class="main"> First big move </div>
    <p> But not so long ago I've changed my place, and that's changed my life. I've gone to another city, its a big capital of one of the European countries. I have started to interesting in different things,
        including information technologies (and that's why i could wrote this page). You know, I've got some friends who helped me to change myself in a better way. Also it became possible to see my special friend here... But later about this.
    </p>
    <h2> Planning for future </h2>
    <p> I'm still not sure what am I gonna do during this life, but I already can say it wont be boring. Not so long ago I have got an idea of what do I want to do in future. 
        More of that, I've already started to make my first steps. Almost every day I'm learning programming (this page I've made in HTML and CSS after a week of studying programming) and that is interesting for me.
        I'm making a progress in czech language and even read a few pages of book in czech without russian copy. And also I did one thing that is the most important for me... But I can't tell you about it now.
